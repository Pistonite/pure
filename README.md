![JSR Version](https://img.shields.io/jsr/v/@pistonite/pure)

Pure TypeScript utility library for browsers

## Libraries
- `fs`: Browser File System Integration
- `log`: Logging library with log export ability
- `result`: Rust-like result handling types and a small number of util functions
- `utils`: I don't know where to put the stuff

## Setup
Install the package from JSR (bunx also works)
```
npx jsr install @pistonite/pure
```

Import the things you need
```typescript
import type { Result } from "@pistonite/pure/result";
```
